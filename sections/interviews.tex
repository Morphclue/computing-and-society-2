\section{Interviews}
\textcolor{red}{TODO: rename into UCD?}

As part of the development of UK4You, interviews were initially carried out in order to gain different perspectives on the platform to be developed.
In order to identify as many problems as possible, both bachelor's and master's students were surveyed.
Ideally, employees, doctoral students or professors would also be interviewed at this point.
However, there was not an option to do this during the survey period.
The survey size of $n=5$ is also far too small to be able to make statements about everyone at the University of Kassel.
Nevertheless, better statements can be made about the platform than if the sample size would be $n=1$.\\

The interviews were conducted using an interview guideline (see \autoref{sec:guideline}).
Normally, semi-structured interviews would be conducted at this point because they are more exploratory compared to guided interviews. \textcolor{red}{cite?}
This is because questions are asked in order to shed more light on facts or to explore ideas further.
At this point, however, it was deliberately avoided in order to gain personal experience with structured interviews and to experience the advantages and disadvantages of both interview-types.\\

The interviews were recorded with a microphone after the consent of the individual students.
The audio files were then transcribed into literal, non-phonetic, transcripts.
The audio transcription process offers the advantage that individual passages in a text can be referenced more easily.
Recorded data can also be anonymized and pseudonymised in this way.
