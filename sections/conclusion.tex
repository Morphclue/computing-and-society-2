\section{Conclusion}
There are still many elements that can be reconsidered or added.
The three mockups developed will probably have a high level of user acceptance due to the methods used.
Before this can be said with certainty, however, the platform must first be tested.
UK4You must be iteratively tested and developed in every way so that the platform meets today's standards and expert knowledge.
The suggestions on the timeline in particular must be examined in detail so that this does not have any negative consequences.
Regular surveys must also be carried out to determine what users think about the platform.
Nevertheless, it can already be said that thanks to the different design processes, thoughts were given to possible consequences and risks.
At least in theory, UK4You should be a productive and inclusive platform for students at the University of Kassel.
