\section{Machine Learning - Research Task 6}\label{sec:ai}
\textcolor{red}{TODO: there is still a lot of stuff that has to be done here}

\subsection{Concerns}
Fairness (no prejudice and should be treated the same)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gender
    \item Students from abroad
\end{itemize}

Accountability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Legal
    \item Reasons for effects through explainability
\end{itemize}

Transparency:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make AI explainable
    \item Interpretable
\end{itemize}


With the help of visualization tools, checklists etc. (provided in "A Framework for Fairness") and the Data Nutrition Project.
