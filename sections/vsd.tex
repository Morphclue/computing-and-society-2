\section{Value Sensitive Design}
% • Make a list of values that are important for the working of this platform (rely on the reading list to identify the values). 
% • Reason how might the value of privacy be defined? Is it in conflict with any other values on your list? 
% • Can you propose technological solutions that safeguard the value of privacy and make the users aware of privacy as a value? 
% • Speculate: should this value be challenged? If so, why and how?
