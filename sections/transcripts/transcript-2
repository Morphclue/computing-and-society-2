    \item \interview{P1} I can't think of anything spontaneously, because I really don't use it that actively.
    \item \interview{IV} What should be included in your profile?
    \item \interview{P1} So nickname, name probably, age, what I'm studying, what semester I'm currently in. But you should be able to customize what information you want to share with others, because not everyone feels comfortable sharing their semester.
    \item \interview{IV} How would you like to share information with other users?
    \item \interview{P1} Like information is shared within facebook in a timeline. You should also have the option to exchange private messages. I think going in both direction is more dynamic.

    \item \interview{IV} Where do you think the weaknesses of such a platform could be?
    \item \interview{P1} That maybe wrong information could spread around.
