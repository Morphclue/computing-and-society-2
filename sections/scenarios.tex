\section{Scenarios}

\subsection{Scenario - Stefan}
Stefan is in a caf√© right now.
Today he travels alone and without his usual friends.
He wants to beautify his profile on UK4You with newly learned skills so that potential employers are aware of him and his skills.
Stefan pulls out his phone and starts editing his profile page.
He has recently learned the Python programming language and feels comfortable with it.
For this reason, he enters Python as a skill under the Skills category.
However, he thinks that it might also make sense to register his participation in the university's coding club there.
So he enters this as well.
Suddenly Stefan receives a notification.
He is curious and clicks the notification.
Max1337 wrote a comment to Stefan under his skill Python: "As if you know Python what nonsense".
The automatic filter system has put the comment on-hold, which is why it is not yet visible to everyone.
Stefan thinks that this comment shouldn't visible and simply removes it.
After he removed the comment he opens the job page of the UK4You platform and looks at the different employers.
Several suggestions are already made there based on Stefan's skills.
However, he has the option to change this filter and adjust his own filter options.
With one click he sends several applications to different companies.
After doing that, he packs his cell phone back to enjoy his coffee.
